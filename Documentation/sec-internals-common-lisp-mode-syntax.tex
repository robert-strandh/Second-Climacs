\section{Syntax}

\subsection{Parsing using the \commonlisp{} reader}

We use a special version of the \commonlisp{} reader to parse the
contents of a buffer.  We use a special version of the reader for the
following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item We need a different action from that of the standard reader when
  it comes to interpreting tokens.  In particular, we do not
  necessarily want the incremental parser to intern symbols
  automatically, and we do not want the reader to fail when a symbol
  with an explicit package prefix does not exist or when the package
  corresponding to the package prefix does not exists.
\item We need for the reader to return not only a resulting
  expression, but an object that describes the start and end positions
  in the buffer where the expression was read.
\item The reader needs to return source elements that are not returned
  by an ordinary reader, such as comments and expressions that are
  skipped by certain other reader macros.
\item The reader can not fail when an incorrect character is
  encountered, nor when end of file is encountered in the middle of a
  call.
\end{itemize}

We call the data structure referred to in the last item a \emph{wad}.
It contains the following slots:

\begin{itemize}
\item The start and the end location of the wad in the
  buffer.  For details on how this wad is represented,
  \refSec{sec-common-lisp-mode-syntax-data-structure}.
\item The expression that was read, with some possible modifications.
  Tokens are not represented as themselves for reasons mentioned
  above.
\item A list of \emph{children}.  These are wads that were
  returned by recursive calls to the reader.  The children are
  represented in the order they were encountered in the buffer.  This
  order may be different from the order in which the corresponding
  expressions appear in the expression resulting from the call to the
  reader.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data structure}
\label{sec-common-lisp-mode-syntax-data-structure}

A location in the buffer is considered a \emph{top-level location} if
and only if, when the buffer is parsed by a number of consecutive
calls to \texttt{read}, when this location is reached, the reader is
in its initial state with no recursive pending invocations.

The \commonlisp{} syntax maintains a sequence%
\footnote{It is not a \commonlisp{} sequence, but just a suite
  represented in a different way.}  of \emph{top-level wads}.
A wad is considered top-level if it is the result of an
immediate call to \texttt{read}, as opposed to of a recursive call.

This sequence is organized as two ordinary \commonlisp{} lists, called
the \emph{prefix} and the \emph{suffix}.  Given a top-level location
$L$ in the buffer, the prefix contains a list of the top-level wad
that precede $L$ and the suffix contains a list of the
top-level wads that follow $L$.  The top-level wads
in the prefix occur in reverse order compared to order in which they
appear in the buffer.  The top-level wads in the suffix occur
in the same order as they appear in the buffer.  the location $L$ is
typically immediately before or immediately after the top-level
expression in which the \emph{cursor} of the current view is located,
but that is not a requirement.  \refFig{fig-cl-parser-prefix-suffix}
illustrates the prefix and the suffix of a buffer with five top-level
expressions.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-cl-parser-prefix-suffix.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-cl-parser-prefix-suffix}
Prefix and suffix containing top-level wads.}
\end{figure}

Either the prefix or the suffix or both may be the empty list.  The
location $L$ may be moved.  It suffices%
\footnote{Some slots also need to be updated as will be discussed later.}
to pop an element off of one
of the lists and push it onto the other.

The representation of a wad is shown in
\refFig{fig-wad}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-wad.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-wad}
Representation of wad.}
\end{figure}

Let the \emph{initial character} of some wad be the first
non-whitespace character encountered during the call to the reader
that produced this wad.  Similarly, let the \emph{final
  character} of some wad be the last character encountered
during the call to the reader that produced this wad,
excluding any look-ahead character that could be un-read before the
wad was returned.

The slot named \texttt{start-line} is computed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the wad is one of the top-level wads in the
  prefix or the first top-level wad in the suffix, then the
  value of this slot is the absolute line number of the initial
  character of this wad.  The first line of the buffer is
  numbered $0$.
\item If the wad is a top-level wad in the suffix other than the first
  one, then the value of this slot is the number of lines between the
  value of the slot \texttt{start-line} of the preceding wad and the
  initial character of this wad.  A value of $0$ indicates the same
  line as the \texttt{start-line} of the preceding wad.
\item If this wad is the first in a list of children of some
  parent wad, then the value of this slot is the number of
  lines between the value of the slot \texttt{start-line} of the parent
  wad and the initial character of this wad.
\item If this wad is the child other than the first in a list
  of children of some parent wad, then the value of this slot
  is the number of lines between the value of the slot
  \texttt{start-line} of the preceding sibling wad and the
  initial character of this wad.
\end{itemize}

The value of the slot \texttt{start-column} is the absolute column
number of the initial character of this wad.  A value of $0$
means the leftmost column.

The value of the slot \texttt{end-line} of some wad is the
number of lines between the value of the slot \texttt{start-line} of
the same wad and the final character of the wad.
If the wad starts and ends on the same line, then the value
of this slot is $0$.

The value of the slot \texttt{end-column} is the absolute column
number of the final character of the wad.

To illustrate the data structure, we use the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
...
34 (f 10)
35
36 (let ((x 1)
37       (y 2))
38   (g (h x)
39      (i y)
40      (j x y)))
41
42 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

Each line is preceded by the absolute line number.  If the wad
starting at line 36 is a member of the prefix or if it is the
first element of the suffix, it would be represented like this:

\begin{verbatim}
36 04 (let ((x 1) (y 2)) (g (h x) (i y) (j x y)))
   00 01 ((x 1) (y 2))
      00 00 (x 1)
      01 00 (y 2)
   02 02 (g (h x) (i y) (j x y))
      00 00 (h x)
      01 00 (i y)
      02 00 (j x y)
\end{verbatim}

Since column numbers are uninteresting for our illustration, we
show only line numbers.  Furthermore, we present a list as a table for
a more compact presentation.

\subsection{Moving top-level wads}

Occasionally, some top-level wads need to be moved from the
prefix to the suffix or from the suffix to the prefix.  There could be
several reasons for such moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item The place between the prefix and the suffix must always be near
  the part of the buffer currently on display when the contents are
  presented to the user.  If the part on display changes as a result
  of scrolling or as a result of the user moving the current cursor,
  then the prefix and suffix must be adjusted to reflect the new
  position prior to the presentation.
\item After items have been inserted into or deleted from the buffer,
  the incremental parser may have to adjust the prefix and the suffix
  so that the altered top-level wads are near the beginning
  of the suffix.
\end{itemize}

These adjustments are always accomplished by repeatedly moving a
single top-level wad.

To move a single top-level wad $P$ from the prefix to the
suffix, the following actions are executed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Modify the slot \texttt{start-line} of the first wad of
  the suffix so that, instead of containing the absolute line number,
  it contains the line number relative to the value of the slot
  \texttt{start-line} of $P$.
\item Pop $P$ from the prefix and push it onto the suffix.  Rather
  than using the straightforward technique, the \texttt{cons} cell
  referring to $P$ can be reused so as to avoid unnecessary consing.
\end{enumerate}

To move a single top-level wad $P$ from the suffix to the
prefix, the following actions are executed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $P$ has a successor $S$ in the suffix, then the slot
  \texttt{start-line} of $S$ is adjusted so that it contains the
  absolute line number as opposed to the line number relative to the
  slot \texttt{start-line} of $P$.
\item Pop $P$ from the suffix and push it onto the prefix.  Rather
  than using the straightforward technique, the \texttt{cons} cell
  referring to $P$ can be reused so as to avoid unnecessary consing.
\end{enumerate}

We illustrate this process by showing four possible top-level
locations in the example buffer.  If all three top-level wads
are located in the suffix, we have the following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
suffix
34 00 (f 10)
02 04 (let ((x 1) (y 2)) (g (h x) (i y) (j x y)))
06 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

In the example, we do not show the children of the top-level wad.

If the prefix contains the first top-level expression and the suffix
the other two, we have the following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
suffix
36 04 (let ((x 1) (y 2)) (g (h x) (i y) (j x y)))
06 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

If the prefix contains the first two top-level expressions and the suffix
the remaining one, we have the following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
36 04 (let ((x 1) (y 2)) (g (h x) (i y) (j x y)))
suffix
42 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

Finally, if the prefix contains all three top-level expressions, we
have the following situation:


\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
36 04 (let ((x 1) (y 2)) (g (h x) (i y) (j x y)))
42 00 (f 20)
suffix
...
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Incremental update}

Modifications to the buffer are reported at the granularity of entire
lines.  The following operations are possible:

\begin{itemize}
\item A line may be modified.
\item A line may be inserted.
\item A line may be deleted.
\end{itemize}

Several different lines may be modified between two incremental
updates, and in different ways.  The first step in an incremental
update step is to invalidate wads that are no longer known to
be correct after these modifications.  This step modifies the data
structure described in
\refSec{sec-common-lisp-mode-syntax-data-structure} in the following
way:

\begin{itemize}
\item After the invalidation step, the prefix contains the wad
  preceding the first modified line, so that these wads are still
  valid.
\item The suffix contains those wads following the last
  modified line.  These wads are still valid, but they may no
  longer be top-level wads, because the nesting may have
  changed as a result of the modifications preceding the suffix.
\item An additional list of \emph{residual wads} is created.
  This list contains wads that have not been invalidated by
  the modifications, i.e. that appear only in lines that have not been
  modified.
\end{itemize}

The order of the wads in the list of residual wads
is the same as the order of the wads in the buffer.  The slot
\texttt{start-line} of each wad in the list is the absolute
line number of the initial character of that wad.

Suppose, for example, that the buffer contents in our running example
was modified so that line 37 was altered in some way, and a line was
inserted between the lines 39 and 40.  As a result of this update, we
need to represent the following wads:

\begin{verbatim}
...
34 (f 10)
35
36       (x 1)
37
38      (h x)
39      (i y)
40
41      (j x y)
42
43 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

In other words, we need to obtain the following representation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residual
36 00 (x 1)
38 00 (h x)
39 00 (i y)
41 00 (j x y)
suffix
43 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Processing modifications}

While the list of residual wads is being constructed, its
elements are in the reverse order.  Only when all buffer updates have
been processed is the list of residual wads reversed to
obtain the final representation.

All line modifications are reported in increasing order of line
number.  Before the first modification is processed, the prefix and
the suffix are positioned as indicated above, and the list of residual
wads is initialized to the empty list.

The following actions are taken, depending on the position of the
modified line with respect to the suffix, and on the nature of the
modification:

\begin{itemize}
\item If a line has been modified, and either the suffix is empty or
  the modified line precedes the first wad of the suffix,
  then no action is taken.
\item If a line has been deleted, and the suffix is empty, then no
  action is taken.
\item If a line has been deleted, and it precedes the first wad
  of the suffix, then the slot \texttt{start-line} of the first
  wad of the suffix is decremented.
\item If a line has been inserted, and the suffix is empty, then no
  action is taken.
\item If a line has been inserted, and it precedes the first wad
  of the suffix, then the slot \texttt{start-line} of the first
  wad of the suffix is incremented.
\item If a line has been modified and the entire first wad of
  the suffix is entirely contained in this line, then remove the first
  wad from the suffix and start the entire process again with
  the same modified line.  To remove the first wad from the
  suffix, first adjust the slot \texttt{start-line} of the second
  element of the suffix (if any) to reflect the absolute start line.
  Then pop the first element off the suffix.
\item If a line has been modified, deleted, or inserted, in a way that
  may affect the first wad of the suffix, then this wad
  is first removed from the suffix and then processed as
  indicated below.  Finally, start the entire process again with the
  same modified line.  To remove the first wad from the
  suffix, first adjust the slot \texttt{start-line} of the second
  element of the suffix (if any) to reflect the absolute start line.
  Then pop the first element off the suffix.
\end{itemize}

Modifications potentially apply to elements of the suffix.  When such
an element needs to be taken apart, we try to salvage as many as
possible of its descendants.  We do this by moving the element to a
\emph{worklist} organized as a stack represented as an ordinary
\commonlisp{} list.  The top of the stack is taken apart by popping it
from the stack and pushing its children.  This process goes on until
either the top element has no children, or it is no longer affected by
a modification to the buffer, in which case it is moved to the list of
residual wads.

Let us see how we process the modifications in our running example.

Line 37 has been altered, so our first task is to adjust the prefix
and the suffix so that the prefix contains the last wad that
is unaffected by the modifications.  This adjustment results in the
following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
worklist
suffix
36 04 (let ((x 1) (y 2)) (g (h x) (i y) (j x y)))
06 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

The first wad of the suffix is affected by the fact that line
37 has been modified.  We must move the children of that wad
to the worklist.  In doing so, we make the \texttt{start-line} of the
children reflect the absolute line number, and we also make the
\texttt{start-line} of the next wad of the suffix also
reflect the absolute line number.  We obtain the following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
worklist
36 01 ((x 1) (y 2))
38 02 (g (h x) (i y) (j x y))
suffix
42 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

The first element of the worklist is affected by the modification of
line 37.  We therefore remove it from the worklist, and add its
children to the top of the worklist.  In doing so, we make the
\texttt{start-line} of those children reflect absolute line numbers.
We obtain the following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
worklist
36 00 (x 1)
37 00 (y 2)
38 02 (g (h x) (i y) (j x y))
suffix
42 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

The first element of the worklist is unaffected by the modification,
because it precedes the modified line entirely.  We therefore move it
to the residue list.  We now have the following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
36 00 (x 1)
worklist
37 00 (y 2)
38 02 (g (h x) (i y) (j x y))
suffix
42 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

The first wad of the top of the worklist is affected by the
modification.  It has no children, so we pop it off the worklist.

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
36 00 (x 1)
worklist
38 02 (g (h x) (i y) (j x y))
suffix
42 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

The modification of line 37 is now entirely processed.  We know this
because the first wad on the worklist occurs beyond the
modified line in the buffer.  We therefore start processing the line
inserted between the existing lines 39 and 40.  The first item on the
worklist is affected by this insertion.  We therefore remove it from
the worklist and push its children instead.  In doing so, we make the
\texttt{start-line} slot those children reflect the absolute line
number.  We obtain the following result:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
36 00 (x 1)
worklist
38 00 (h x)
39 00 (i y)
40 00 (j x y)
suffix
42 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

The first element of the worklist is unaffected by the insertion
because it precedes the inserted line entirely.  We therefore move it
to the residue list.  We now have the following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
36 00 (x 1)
38 00 (h x)
worklist
39 00 (i y)
40 00 (j x y)
suffix
42 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

Once again, the first element of the worklist is unaffected by the
insertion because it precedes the inserted line entirely.  We
therefore move it to the residue list.  We now have the following
situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
36 00 (x 1)
38 00 (h x)
39 00 (i y)
worklist
40 00 (j x y)
suffix
42 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

The first element of the worklist is affected by the insertion, in
that it must have its line number incremented.  In fact, every element
of the worklist and also the first element of the suffix must have
their line numbers incremented.  Furthermore, this update finishes the
processing of the inserted line.  We now have the following situation:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
36 00 (x 1)
38 00 (h x)
39 00 (i y)
worklist
41 00 (j x y)
suffix
43 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

With no more buffer modifications to process, we terminate the
procedure by moving remaining wads from the worklist to the
residue list.  The final situation is shown here:

\begin{verbatim}
prefix
...
34 00 (f 10)
residue
36 00 (x 1)
38 00 (h x)
39 00 (i y)
41 00 (j x y)
worklist
suffix
43 00 (f 20)
...
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Recreating the cache}

Once the cache has been processed so that only wads that are
known to be valid remain, the new buffer contents must be fully parsed
so that its complete structure is reflected in the cache.

Conceptually, we obtain a complete cache by applying \texttt{read}
repeatedly from the beginning of the buffer, until all top-level wad
have been found.  But doing it this way essentially for every
keystroke would be too slow.  In this section we explain how the
partially invalidated cache is used to make this process sufficiently
fast.
